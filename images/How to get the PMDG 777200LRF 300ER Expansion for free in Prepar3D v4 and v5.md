However, the PMDG 777-200LR/F 300ER Expansion is not a cheap product. It costs $29.99 for the 777-300ER and $77.72 for the 777-200ER on the PMDG website. If you want to save some money and get these products for free, you might be tempted to look for cracked versions or torrents online. But beware, these sources are not reliable and can expose your computer to viruses, malware, or other security risks. Moreover, you will not be able to enjoy the latest updates, fixes, and support from PMDG if you use an illegal copy of their products.
 
So, what is the best way to get the PMDG 777-200LR/F 300ER Expansion for free in Prepar3D v4 and v5? The answer is simple: wait for a sale or a promotion from PMDG. PMDG occasionally offers discounts on their products during special occasions, such as holidays, anniversaries, or product launches. For example, in January 2021, they offered a 22% discount on all their products to celebrate their 22nd year in business. If you are patient and attentive, you might be able to catch a similar deal in the future and get the PMDG 777-200LR/F 300ER Expansion for a fraction of its original price.
 
Another option is to join a loyalty program or a subscription service that gives you access to PMDG products for a monthly or yearly fee. For example, Aerosoft offers a subscription service called Aerosoft One that allows you to download and install over 100 Aerosoft products for Prepar3D v4 and v5 for â¬9.99 per month or â¬99 per year. Among these products are the PMDG 777-200LR/F and the PMDG 777-300ER Expansion. However, note that this service does not include the PMDG 777-200ER Expansion, which is exclusive to the PMDG website.
 
In conclusion, there is no legal way to get the PMDG 777-200LR/F 300ER Expansion for free in Prepar3D v4 and v5. The only way to enjoy these high-quality products without paying anything is to wait for a sale or a promotion from PMDG or to join a subscription service that includes them. Otherwise, you will have to pay the full price or risk using an illegal copy that can harm your computer and your simulation experience.
